# Misleading Graph Generator

This tool exists to educate people that a graph shows nothing
– or everything – if its axes are chosen unwisely. Note that the
generated graphs are *accurate*, if the source data is. They’re
simply very misleading. Please refer people here who thoughtlessly
draw conclusions from suggestive or misleading graphs.
